  Scenario: Test using 'Embed question' button
    Given I am on the "Course 1" course page logged in as teacher
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "page" to section "1" using the activity chooser
    And I set the field "Name" to "Test page 01"
    And I set the field "Description" to "Test page description"
    And I set the field "content" to "Test page content"
    And I click on "Embed question" "button"
    And I set the field "Question category" to "Test questions [embed] (1)"
    And I set the field "id_questionidnumber" to "First question [test1]"
    And I click on "Embed question" "button" in the "Embed question" "dialogue"
