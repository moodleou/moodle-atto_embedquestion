## Changes in 1.5

  and there was no scroll bar.


## Changes in 1.4

* Internal changes because of the recent changes in the filter code.


## Changes in 1.3

* This version works better Moodle 3.6+, where question and categories have a proper 'Id number'

  This is now used instead of the previous hack of putting the id in the name.
